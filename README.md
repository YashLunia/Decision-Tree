# Decision-Tree
Decision tree are built using a heuristic called recursive partitioning. This approach is also commonly known as "Divide &amp; Conquer", because it splits data into subsets which are further split into smaller subsets until the process stops when the alogrithm determines the data within the subsets are sufficiently homogenous, or other stopping criterion has been met.
